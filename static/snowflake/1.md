# Snowflake at your service

_July 13, 2019_

The pleasure is all mine, my friend. This operation is my newest venture. Of course, like 
anything useful and interesting we do this website began as my idea. Keeps Pebbles 
productive, gives Firescar direction, keeps Bubbles out of her own head. Maybe ironic, 
as this digital landscape is as much a shared realm as the mind we coinhabit (if not more 
so), but we all could benefit from some marked personal territory.
Naturally I have my own stories to tell.

- meta - I'll be providing more context on who we are and where we are going
- facts and logic - data is beatiful no? Firescar and I share this passion.
- social work - we live in a society
- long term goals - of us all I am the primary strategist
